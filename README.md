# Linear Regression from Scratch: A Historical and Practical Introduction

This project introduces linear regression through a combination of historical context, mathematical derivation, and practical implementation. It is designed for students and professionals interested in machine learning, data science, and the foundational techniques of predictive modeling.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents

- A brief history of linear regression
- Derivation of the method of least squares
- Introduction to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function
- Gradient descent from scratch
- Application to real housing data
- Visualizations comparing learned models to observed data
- Discussion on global minima and convexity
- Future directions: Stochastic Gradient Descent and matrix notation

## ðŸ§  Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Basic knowledge of calculus (e.g., partial derivatives, chain rule) is helpful

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
